TODO for schedtoold:
- better way to get notified about process creation instead of current polling
- identify proccess correct with it's full path
  What about java, mono, ... ??
- reload config and update all proccess after SIG_HUP
- may included schedtool itself into binary (should be faster and return values
  of schedtool can be used)
- add more usefull examples (also add them on homepage)
