Version 0.3
- renamed to schedtoold (instead of scheD) for gentoo packaging conformance
- renamed sched.cfg to schedtoold.conf, it's more "standard" conform 
  (Andreas Mohr)
- new features:
  - "-p pid_file" option
  - "-u sec" option to set update interval
  - possibility to define rules per user or group in schedtoold.conf
    look at doc/README and doc/schedtoold.conf-example
  - absolute paths for executables are now supported, like /usr/bin/xmms
    AND STRONGLY RECOMMENDED! Look at doc/README for details.
    (Solution isn't perfect yet. See discussion on ck-mailing list.)
  - gentoo and debian init-scripts (thanks Ray for his contribution)
  - running as non-root is now supported, only processes with schedtoold's
    uid will be touched
- fixes:
  - wildcard support
  - changed error messages of schedtool (Javier Kohen)
  - spelling fixes (Andreas Mohr)

Version 0.2
- support for wildcards (name* , but the '*' must be at the end of programm
name)
- improved config file handling (f.e. no limit for count of configured programms)
- more error checking
- verbose improved (when running -v)
- use pid_t instead of int
- updated sched.cfg example
- added schedtool-1.2.4.patch for newer ck-patchset to handle SCHED_ISO right
- last and least: run indent to format source code :)

Version 0.1
- initial release
